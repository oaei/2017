<h1>Anatomy</h1>


<h2>General description</h2>

<p>The Anatomy track consists of finding an alignment between the Adult Mouse Anatomy and a part of the NCI Thesaurus (describing the human anatomy). The task is placed in a domain where we find large, carefully designed ontologies that are described in technical terms. Besides their large size and a conceptualization that is only to a limited degree based on the use of natural language, they also differ from other ontologies with respect to the use of specific annotations and roles, e.g. the extensive use of the partOf relation. The manual harmonization of the ontologies leads to a situation, where we have a high number of rather trivial mappings that can be found by simple string comparison techniques. At the same time, we have a good share of non-trivial mappings that require a careful analysis and sometimes also medical background knowledge.</p>


<!--
<h2>Modalities</h2>
-->

<p>The anatomy track in 2017 consists of the default task to match the two ontologies of the anatomy track with the standard configuration of your matching system.</p>

<p>In the past, we have evaluated matching systems with respect to their ability to exploit an input alignment (= partial reference alignment). We will include this modality of evaluation, in case it is requested prior to the final deadline by at least three participants. In case your tool offers such a functionality and you want it to be evaluated, please write a mail to the track organizers (mail see at the bottom of this page).</p><p>


</p><p>The general schedule given at <a href="http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2017/">the OAEI main page</a> is binding for the anatomy track. Moreover, you have to submit your wrapped tool as explained on the OAEI main page.</p>

<h2>Results available</h2>

<p>The preliminary results for OAEI have been generated and are available now (30.09.2017). <a href="http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2017/results/anatomy/index.html"><b>Link to results page.</b></a></p>


<h2><a name="datasets">Data sets</a></h2>

<p>It is highly recommended that you run local tests to see whether your matching system can cope with the dataset. There are two options:</p>

<p>(1) You can <a href="http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2017/anatomy/anatomy-dataset.zip">download the whole dataset</a> and run your tests with this input data.</p>

<p>(2) However, finally you have to wrap your tool against the SEALS client provided via the OAEI main page and run this client against the Anatomy testsuite. For this purpose, a tutorial is linked via the OAEI 2017 page. For running the Anatomy testsuite you will have to specify the following input parameters.</p>

  <li>Repository: <span class="testsuiteid">http://repositories.seals-project.eu/tdrs/</span></li>

  <li>Version-ID: <span class="testsuiteid">anatomy_track-default</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>

<p>We recommend to wrap and test your tool with the SEALS client at an early stage!</p>
