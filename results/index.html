<h1>Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative</h1>
<h1>2017 results</h1>

<p>
We distinguish between matching systems that have
participated in the ontology matching tracks and matching systems that have
participated in the instance matching track. There were 6 ontology matching
tracks: 
anatomy, conference, multifarm, interactive, largebio and phenotype; 
and 3 instance matching tracks (pm, im and hobbit).
This year all tracks run under SEALS apart from the hobbit track which relied on the HOBBIT platform.
</p>
<p>
Some systems had problems to generate results for some SEALS tracks, 
but this can also be counted as a result. 
Links to the pages describing the results for each track can be found at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>The OAEI 2017 had 30 systems registered although in the end only 21 were submitted and evaluated.  

<!--who participated in xxx tests
 --> 
(this is in the line of OAEI 2015 which had 22 participants).</p>


<p>Twelve of the systems participating in OAEI 2017 had
  participated in previous campaigns (ALIN, AML, CroLOM, DisMatch-ar, DisMatch-sg, DisMatch-tr, I-Match, LogMap, LogMapLt, LogMap-Bio, WikiV2, XMap),
  while nine were new participants (KEPLER, Legato, njuLink, ONTMAT, POMAP, RADON, SANOM, Silk, YAM-BIO).</p>
  
<p>DiSMatch variants was evaluated off-line by the authors since 
it required a large amount of resources to run. Tool1 developer decided to withdraw the system, so we keep the results 
in some tracks only as reference.  
</p>
  
<p>Table 1 shows their participation along the different OAEI tracks.</p>

  <figcaption>Table 1. Participants and their success in the different OAEI track. A white circle indicates that the system did not participate in the track; a black circle  indicates that it participated 
  fully in the track; and a A half-black circle indicates that it participated in or completed only part of the tasks of the track. Confidence stands for the<br/> type of results returned by a system: it is ticked when the confidence is a non-boolean value.</figcaption>
