<h1>SEALS evaluation for OAEI 2017</h1>


<p>

The SEALS project was
dedicated to the evaluation of semantic web technologies. 
To that extent, it created infrastructure for easing this evaluation,
organizing evaluation campaigns, and building the community of tool
providers and tool users around this evaluation activity.
The SEALS infrastructure is now routingly used in ontology matching evaluation.
</p>

<p>
To ease communication between participants and track organizers, 
we will have two OAEI contact points: <b>Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz</b> (ernesto [.] jimenez [.] ruiz [at] gmail [.] com) and 
<b>Daniel Faria</b> (daniel [.] faria [.] 81 [at] gmail [.] com). General questions about the OAEI campaign (deadlines, registration, tool wrapping, 
submissions, rules, datasets, etc.) should be addressed to Ernesto. Technical questions about the use of the SEALS client and potential 
library incompatibilities should be addressed to Daniel.

</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>
Participants have to follow this procedure:
<ol>
  <li><b>Register your matching tool.</b> Participants must register their intention to participate in the OAEI 2017  
  by filling this <a href="https://goo.gl/qMiH6x">online form</a>.    	
  </li>

  <li><b>Save instructions to upload your tool.</b> Zipped SEALS packages (e.g., LogMap.zip) can be submitted using <a href="https://goo.gl/xEwpiq">this form</a> (requires a google account and a valid email). 
  <!--After registering a system the OAEI contact person will send details about how to submit your system.-->    	
  </li>

  <li><b>Wrap the current version of your matching tool.</b>
	This step is described in detail in a tutorial (see <a href="#tutorial">Section below</a>). 
	It requires to create a small java class that acts as a bridge. Further, you have to put the libraries used by your tool in a certain folder structure.

  <li><b>Test your tool with the data sets available for each track.</b> Ids of data sets for testing your tool prior to the evaluation process are given in each 
  track web page. Participants can test their tools with the <a href="#tutorial">SEALS client</a> on those data-sets. 
  For each track test, please inform the concerned track organizer about the status of your test. 
  This will facilitate the final evaluation process. If you desire, you can send a copy of your e-mail to the OAEI contact point.
	</li>
	
  <li><b>Upload a wrapped version of your matching tool and ask
	for a dry run.</b> It is convenient that participants (locally) test their wrapped tool way before the deadline. 
	We can also give you support and perform a dry run in our machines. 
  </li>

  <li><b>Prepare, wrap and upload the final version of your matching tool.</b> 
        </span>
        Many system developers work hard till the final deadline is reached to improve their system. 
        Please wrap the final version of your system as you did for a previous test version in Step 3. 
        For the final evaluation we will use the latest version that has been uploaded prior to the deadline.
	</li>
	
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Previously, some tracks had experienced problems for running all the the tools under 
the same JDK version. 
Some participants continue to use JDK 1.6.xx, 
but new participants tend to use JDK 1.7. or even 1.8. 
To facilitate the evaluation process please try to run your tool under this version (JDK 1.7). If it is not possible for you, please keep us informed.

</p>
<p>
Once these steps have been conducted, we run all systems on the SEALS infrastructure and generate the results. 
<!--Each track organizer will decide whether the results will finally be presented via the SEALS portal or if 
they will be presented via result pages (similar as in the years before), or both.-->

<h2>Tutorial on Tool Wrapping</h2>

<p>We have prepared a comprehensive PDF-tutorial for wrapping an ontology matching tool and testing your tool. You can download it here:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/DanFaria/OAEI_SealsClient/blob/master/SealsClientTutorial.pdf">Download Tutorial (May 2017) </a> and 
	<a href="../2011/tutorial/MatcherBridge.java">MatcherBridge.java</a> presented in the appendix.
	</li>	
</ul>

<p>In the tutorial there are mentioned several additional materials that are available here.<p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="../2011/tutorial/linux/demomatcher-package.zip">Download demomatcher-package.zip</a> for LINUX (example of a tool correctly packaged)<br/>
	or <a href="../2011/tutorial/windows/demomatcher-package.zip">download demomatcher-package.zip</a> for WINDOWS <br/>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="../2011/tutorial/seals-omt-validator.jar">Download seals-omt-validator.jar</a> (validates the structure and content of the zipped tool package)</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/DanFaria/OAEI_SealsClient/releases">Download latest seals-omt-client.jar</a> (interfaces and client to execute the final tool package)</li>
</ul>


<p>We have also prepared a tutorial to communicate with the Oracle in the <a href="interactive/index.html">interactive track:</a>

<ul>
	<li>The <a href="https://github.com/DanFaria/OAEI_SealsClient/blob/master/OracleTutorial.pdf">Oracle tutorial (May 2017)</a> include details about
	 how matching systems can use the Oracle class for Interactive Matching.</li>
</ul>

<p>We detected some problems in the past when using libraries in conflict with the libraries used by the SEALS client. We encourage when possible 
to use the same versions as the <a href="https://github.com/DanFaria/OAEI_SealsClient/releases">SEALS client</a>.
Please check the <b><i>maven</i> dependencies of the SEALS client</b> <a href="https://github.com/DanFaria/OAEI_SealsClient/blob/master/SealsClientSource/pom.xml">here</a>.
Note that <span class="important">you must not include the SEALS client jar file within your
wrapped system</span>.</p>

<p>We also encourage developers to use the <a href="http://alignapi.gforge.inria.fr/">Alignment API</a>. For developers using it, 
the following ant package is available for packaging and validating the wrapped tools: <p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="../2011/tutorial/package-template.zip">Download package-template.zip</a> Use 'ant pack' to generate the tool package.</li><br/>
</ul>


<p>
Within the Tutorial we show how you can use your wrapped tool to run locally a full evaluation. 
Thus, you can compute precision and recall for all of those testsuites listed in the track web pages at any time in your development process.</p>






<h2>Contacts</h2>
<p>
Do not hesitate to contact Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz (ernesto [.] jimenez [.] ruiz [at] gmail [.] com) and Daniel Faria (daniel [.] faria [.] 81 [at] gmail [.] com) for any question you may have.


</p>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>While developing and improving the tutorial, we have been in contact with several matching tool developer to have some 'reference' matcher for testing our tutorial and the client that comes with it. Thanks go out to Hua Wei Khong Watson (Eff2match), Peigang Xu (Falcon-OA), Faycal Hamdi (Taxomap), Peng Wang (Lily), Zhichun Wang (RiMOM), and Cosmin Stroe (AgreementMaker).
